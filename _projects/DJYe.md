**"DJ Ye"** is a feature-rich Discord music bot that allows users to play and manage music directly 
in voice channels with simple commands and an intuitive interface.

I developed this bot to enhance Discord server experiences with seamless music playback, robust queue management, 
and an interactive user interface that makes controlling music as simple as clicking a button.
